# Duolingo Data Analysis (48 hour effort)

At the end of 2018, Duolingo conducted a survey of its users. The survey asked a series of questions about demographics (e.g., country, age, employment status), and motivation (e.g., primary reason for studying a language). The goal was to develop user segments (or personas) to inform marketing efforts and product development.  

This dataset contains some results from the survey as well as users included in it. Collection occurred from August 1st, 2018 to November 5th, 2018. The data required cleaning and reformatting.  

## Objectives:
1. Explore the data
2. Use quantitative methods to identify a set of user segments/personas
3. Identify any actionable product or marketing insights

This report shall cover a high-level summary of the methods, a description of proposed use personas, key visualizations, and recommendation for product changes and marketing campaigns.  

The principal audience is those with technical backgrounds, but not necessarily data scientists.
